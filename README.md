<div align="center">I like to create things <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/4803/4803405.png" width="13"/><br/><br/>I'm Leonardo Grigorio Araujo, a web developer with a wide range of skills and experience. I have a background in graphics design, video editing, and digital marketing, which gives me a unique perspective in web development. I have a passion for building web projects from start to finish and I specialize in creating tools for the financial market. At 23 years old, I created a successful app that helped me to jump into the industry. Currently, I work at a company called "supernova" in Brazil, where I continue to learn and create tools that make people's lives easier. I love learning and creating things that people will use and enjoy.</div>
