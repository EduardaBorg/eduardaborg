<div align="center">I'm a work in progress <img src="https://cdn-icons-png.flaticon.com/512/4803/4803405.png" width="13"/><br/><br/>My name is Eduarda Borges Ferreira, and I am a back-end developer with basic experience in several programming languages and tools. I am currently in the process of specializing and improving my skills in a specific direction. Ever since I was young, I have had a passion for math and technology. At the age of 14, I gained some initial experience helping my grandfather with basic installations, which further ignited my interest in the field. I particularly enjoy working with Java, although my Github profile may not reflect this as I mainly use Gitlab as my workspace for iFood (a popular food tech unicorn app in Brazil).
    <br/>
    I am currently in the 5th semester of Mechatronics Engineering at the Federal Institute of GoiÃ¡s. I am involved in some academic projects, including "Segue o Bicho," an application for tracking wild animals with the intention of contributing to the correct treatment of animals that have been in captivity.</div>
